# Offline 4e Compendium v3.5 and v4 High Level Design Doc #

Last updated: 2016-07-13

## 1. Introduction ##
### 1.1 Background ###

This product is for retrieving entries from official compendium of D&D 4th edition, store them locally, and let users browse and search them offline.

This product does not contain any copyrighted data by itself,
and saving for personal use does not violate copyright either.

### 1.2 Goals ###

Downloader:
1. A Java GUI program (single jar) that takes a login and download compendium entries.
2. Handles transform and indexing of downloaded data for viewer consumption.
3. Can export a complete viewer solution by itself.
4. Only save raw downloaded data to database; data transform and index can be enhanced by program update.
5. No multi-lingual.  Target audance should all read English.

v3.5 Viewer:
1. Update, fix, enhance the unfinished v3 viewer, so that it can last till v4 is ready.
2. The rest of this doc is about v4 viewer.

v4 Viewer:
1. A HTML file that loads jsonp data from subdirectory.
2. Provide advanced search capability such as OR search, exclude term, phase search, regex search.
3. Responsive layout that fit mobile, pad, and desktop.
4. Multiple entry clipboard for storing .
5. Auto-lookup between entries (popup, can expand to be the main entry).
6. Printer and keyboard friendly.
7. No multi-lingual.  Data is *lots of* English, better keep UI consistent with data.

## 2. Design ##
### 2.1 Downloader Screens ###

The downloader use a tabbed page design with no menu or bar.
It has three states:
 * Idle
 * Downloading (Running or Stopping)
 * Exporting (Running or Stopping)

Data is downloaded by running a WebView, and stored raw in SQLite database using SQLJet.
Both entry and listing are stored.  Category is fixed; no point make it dynamic, now that 4e has ceased development.

1. Data screen
  * [Label] Status
  * [Text input] Login name
  * [Text input] Login password
  * [List] Category list, saved, downloaded, and total
  * [Button] Left button - Download / Export / Stop
  * [Button] Right button - View / Exit

2. Option screen
  * [Number input] Download interval
  * [Number input] Entry retry count (with 25k entries, error is bound to happen)
  * [Number input] Agent string
  * [Checkbox] Show debug tabs
  * [Button] Clear downloaded data

3. Log screen (Debug)
  * [Text area] Execution Log

4. WebView screen (Debug)
  * [WebView] The view actually used to download data.

5. License screen
  * [HTML area] Help, FAQ, and License

### 2.2 Download Workflow ###

Data is loaded by a JavFX WebView and extracted both with JavaScript.

1. Test login (see entry login step below)
2. Foreach category with no entry count
  3. Load Category xsl and xml
  4. Apply xsl on xml to get entry info and save all.
  5. Update category count
6. Foreach entry with no data
  7. Load the entry
  8. If login screen -> try login -> stop if cannot login
  9. Otherwise -> save entry data

### 2.3 Viewer Screens ###

The viewer is an app like offline webpage with multiple screens,
with a left sliding menu.

1. Fixed top header
 * [Button] Menu (mobile only)
 * [Button] Top (if scrolled)
 * Title
 * [Button] Dynamic nav button depending on page
 * [Button] Back / Forward (self-managed, not use browser history)

2. Menu items
 * Search (persist previous state)
 * My Lists
 * PC resources (jump to search screen)
 * DM resources (jump to search screen)
 * [Checkbox] Options - Highlight & Entry popup & Day/Night mode
 * About

3. Search screen
 * [Nav Button] Star - add search result to current or new list
 * [Text] Search input
 * [Toggle] Seach name / Search full
 * [List] Category to search (Grouped by PC and DM)
 * [List] Filter (If single category)
 * [Button] View all
 * [List] Search result (updated live)
 * Search state is saved on navigation

4. Entry screen (single or multiple)
 * [Nav Button] Star - add entry to current or new list
 * [List] Entries to view

5. List screen

6. About screen
 * Version
 * Link to Github
 * License

## 3. Data ##
### 3.1. Downloader raw data ###

These data are stored by downloader in SQLite.

When the downloader generate a viewer, it well compile, sort, and save the raw data into viewer's format.

1. Config (store database version; not much use)
 * key
 * value

2. Category list (fixed)
 * id (Compendium id)
 * name
 * count (total entry, not saved entry; -1 until whole entry listing is saved)
 * order (for export)
 * flelds (CSV Headers)

3. Entry list by category
 * id (Compendium id)
 * name
 * fields (CSV row of list field, except name)
 * data (Raw HTML)

### 3.1. Viewer data ###

Viewer data is hieracial and id in UTF-8.

Category is loaded to main thread and data thread on load.
All non-main threads are shared worker, to support data sharing in multiple tab.

Listing is loaded to data thread lazily with Promise.
Data is loaded to data thread lazily with Promise, stored in a WeakMap.
When idle, the data thread will clean up old text, allowing memory to drop, until all text are dropped.

Name index is loaded to name worker, for instant search.
Full text index is loaded by fulltext worker lazily, and is released on idle.

Data may be stored in compressed form.
Should try to combine data files to combat the massive file count we have now.

1. Listing
 * id
 * name
 * field_headess
 * entries
   * id
   * name
   * fields as simple propery
   * last access date
   * data key

2. Entry (weakmap)
  * entry data key => data

3. Name list
 * id
 * name
 * category

4. Search index
 * id
 * category
 * full text (without flavour text, without item in item set)
