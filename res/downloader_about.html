         <h2 id='help'> How to Use </h2>
         <ol>
            <li>
               <b>You need an active (paid) <a href='https://store.digitalriver.com/store/dndi/DisplayHelpPage'>D&amp;D Insider subscription</a>.</b> <br/>
               You can check / recover your DDI account from its <a href='http://ddi.wizards.com/'>official site.</a>
               This program cannot access protected content without an active subscription.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Fill the login in Data tab.</b> <br/>
               This downloader relies on you to fill in correct DDI login information.
               This downloader only send your login to the DDI site.
               Password is remembered on your machine (though not with saved data); delete it after download to be safe.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Click "Download" and leave it running</b> <br/>
               The download process takes at least a day or longer.
               Progress is saved in real time, so it can be stopped mid-way and it will resume from there next time.
               The download step requires Internet connection and an active subscription.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Click "Export" and save it somewhere </b> <br/>
               Once data is complete, the download button will become export button.
               Export is a process of converting downloaded data into a form that web browsers can read.
               It starts anew every time, usually takes a few minutes, and need 1GB memory.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>(Optional) Transfer the exported file and data to mobile devices </b> <br/>
               The exported <code>.html</code> file can be opened in any modern browser,
               and it comes with a same named folder that contains the data.
               You can copy the file and the folder to other PC or mobile devices;
               copying data to your personal devices for personal use does not violate copyright.
            </li>
            <li>
               If you find a typo or obvious mistake in the compendium, please <a href='https://github.com/Sheep-y/trpg-dnd-4e-db/issues/'>file an issue</a>.
               I cannot update the official compendium, but I can update this downloader's data export.

         <ol>
            <li>
               <b>How to get DDI subscription?</b> <br/>
               <ol>
                  <li>You need to have <a href='http://ddi.wizards.com/'>registered</a> and paid before <a href='http://www.enworld.org/forum/content.php?3087-4e-DnD-Insider-Moving'>2015 Dec</a>.</li>
                  <li>Old email based DDI account must be <a href='https://accounts.wizards.com/'>upgraded</a>, which happens when you login to DDI.</li>
                  <li>Find help from your D&amp;D community if you never subscripted, sorry I can't help.</li>
                  <li>To <a href='https://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2297/=1'>buy access</a>, view an old subscription in <a href='https://store.digitalriver.com/DRHM/store?Action=DisplayAccountOrderListPage&SiteID=dndi'>order history</a> and click "renew" to place a new order.</li>
                  <li>Once paid, you can <a href='https://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2297/=1.01'>disable auto-renew</a> by viewing the new order and follow its manage link.</li>
               </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Cannot open / read / write database</b> <br/>
               Try "Reset Data" in option tab.  You will need to re-download the data. <br/>
               Data is stored in "dnd4_compendium.database", and backups may be available in same folder.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Connection timeout</b> <br/>
               Increase the timeout period in option tab; long pages like power list will take a while to retrieve.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Connection reset</b>
               It usually means your Internet connection was abruptly broken.
               Try increase retry count in option tab, or try another network.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Slow download</b> <br/>
               <i>Whoever is patient has great understanding, but one who is quick-tempered displays folly.</i> - Proverbs 14:29 <br/>
               Decrease the throttle rate in option tab, but there are 25k pieces of data to download after all.
               That is 14 hours if your Internet can get it at 1 per 2 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>How to export to my phone / pad?</b> <br/>
               USB drive is pretty fool-proof.
               Android <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=transfer+file+to+android'>is also easy</a>.
               Just remember to transfer the data folder too (Windows's File Explorer will do that for you.)
               <br/>
               Other mobile OS (iOS, ChromeOS, Win mobile etc) I have no clue.
               <!--I cannot promise it will work on an <a href='http://safari-is-the-new-ie.com/'>outdated browser</a>
               that looks good only because of a <a href='http://www.howtogeek.com/184283/why-third-party-browsers-will-always-be-inferior-to-safari-on-iphone-and-ipad/'>lockout policy</a>.-->
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException</b>
               Only got this error once.  Simply close the downloader and re-run.
