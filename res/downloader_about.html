         <h2 id='help'> How to Use </h2>
         <ol>
            <li>
               <b>You need an active (paid) <a href='https://store.digitalriver.com/store/dndi/DisplayHelpPage'>D&amp;D Insider subscription</a>.</b> <br/>
               You can check / recover your DDI account from its <a href='http://ddi.wizards.com/'>official site.</a>
               This program cannot access protected content without an active subscription.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Fill the login in Data tab.</b> <br/>
               This downloader relies on you to fill in correct DDI login information.
               This downloader only send your login to the DDI site.
               Password is remembered on your machine (though not with saved data); delete it after download to be safe.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Click "Download" and leave it running</b> <br/>
               The download process takes at least a day or longer.
               Progress is saved in real time, so it can be stopped mid-way and it will resume from there next time.
               The download step requires Internet connection and an active subscription.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Click "Export" and save it somewhere </b> <br/>
               Once data is complete, the download button will become export button.
               Export is a process of converting downloaded data into a form that web browsers can read.
               It starts anew every time, usually takes a few minutes, and need 1GB memory.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>(Optional) Transfer the exported file and data to mobile devices </b> <br/>
               The exported <code>.html</code> file can be opened in most browser,
               and it comes with a same named folder that contains the data.
               You can copy the file and the folder to other PC or <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=transfer+file+to+android'>mobile devices</a>.
               <!--copying data to your personal devices for personal use does not violate copyright.-->
            </li>
            <li>
               If you find a <a href='https://github.com/Sheep-y/trpg-dnd-4e-db/#user-content-fixing-compendium-errors'>typo or obvious mistake</a>, please <a href='https://github.com/Sheep-y/trpg-dnd-4e-db/issues/'>file an issue</a>.
               I cannot update the official compendium, but I can update this downloader's data export.

         <ol>
            <li>
               <b>How to get DDI subscription?</b> <br/>
               <ol>
                  <li>You need to have <a href='http://ddi.wizards.com/'>registered</a> and paid before <a href='http://www.enworld.org/forum/content.php?3087-4e-DnD-Insider-Moving'>2015 Dec</a>.</li>
                  <li>Old email based DDI account must be <a href='https://accounts.wizards.com/'>upgraded</a>, which happens when you login to DDI.</li>
                  <li>Find help from your D&amp;D community if you never subscripted, sorry I can't help.</li>
                  <li>To <a href='https://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2297/=1'>buy access</a>, view an old subscription in <a href='https://store.digitalriver.com/DRHM/store?Action=DisplayAccountOrderListPage&SiteID=dndi'>order history</a> and click "renew" to place a new order.</li>
                  <li>Once paid, you can <a href='https://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2297/=1.01'>disable auto-renew</a> by viewing the new order and follow its manage link.</li>
               </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Cannot open / read / write database</b> <br/>
               Data is stored in "dnd4_compendium.database", and a backup is normally in the same folder which you can try to manually restore. <br/>
               If that doesn't help, try "Reset Data" in option tab.  You will need to re-download all data after reset.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Connection timeout</b> <br/>
               Increase the timeout period in option tab; long pages like power list will take a while to retrieve.
               Can also mean a broken or blocked Internet connection.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Connection reset</b> <br/>
               Try increase retry count in option tab, or try a more stable network.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Slow download</b> <br/>
               <i>Whoever is patient has great understanding, but one who is quick-tempered displays folly.</i> - Proverbs 14:29 <br/>
               Decrease the throttle rate in option tab, but there are 25k pieces of data to download after all.
               That is 14 hours if your Internet can get it at 1 per 2 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Slow export</b> <br/>
               Temporary disable anti-virus before export.
               (Windows has a default AV called Windows Defender.)
               You can also add the export location to the anti-virus' white list. <br/>
               Alternatively, get a faster computer.
               My development PC can go from startup to finish export in 8 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Slow export at the end</b> <br/>
               Disk writes are buffered in system memory and/or harddisk memory.
               When the write cache is full, subsequence writes has to wait.
               This effect is particularly pronounced on this program, which may improve in future versions.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>~ failed (script error)</b> <br/>
               This means the login form or compendium has been changed (again).
               May need a programmer to solve this one. See "other errors" below.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Unknown host</b> <br/>
               Most likely, wizards has pulled the plug on ddi.wizards.com.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Not enough space</b> <br/>
               Check the drive where you are exporting data.
               Exported data is 60 MB in slze,
               but some devices <a href='http://www.howtogeek.com/180369/why-is-there-a-big-difference-between-size-and-size-on-disk/'>may require</a> 100+ MB.
               <br/>
               If you have used old version (3.5.1 or before) and is overwriting older export, please delete old export first.
               New version use a more efficient format that dramatically reduce waste space and speedup file copy.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Data is different from official compendium</b> <br/>
               This downloader will fix known mistakes and re-catogarise some data.
               See <a href='https://github.com/Sheep-y/trpg-dnd-4e-db/#user-content-fixing-compendium-errors'>project homepage</a> for a summary,
               and the in-app debug log will log each affected entry.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Other errors</b> <br/>
               For export problem - like a ClosedChannelException that I ran into once -
               try close program and re-export.<br/>

               For download problem, many things can go wrong,
               such as if Wizards changed something <i>again</i>.<br/>

               If you enable debug tabs and restart program, you can see a detailed log,
               and can also see and control the embedded browser.<br/>

               For example, if you determine that there may be a login problem,
               you can try to login from the browser.
               That may allows downloads to proceed normally.<br/>

               If you wish to report <a href='https://github.com/Sheep-y/trpg-dnd-4e-db/issues/'>an issue</a>,
               remember to copy and paste the log or save it as an attachment,
               perhaps with a screenshot of the internal browser.
