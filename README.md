# Offline 4e Database #

**For full source please see <a href="http://github.com/Sheep-y/trpg-dnd-4e-db/tree/master">master branch</a>.**

This script can be used to reterives and locally store entries from online 4e <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dndinsider/compendium/database.aspx">D&D Compendium</a>.
 <br/>
Stored entries can be browsed and searched using a Google-like index with multi-word term search, wildcast, exclusion, inclusion ("OR"), and even regular expression.

This is a fan-made project and does not contain any copyrighted data.
You will need an active <a href="http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Subscription.aspx">Dungeons & Dragons Insider subscription</a> to reterive or update data.
This is not an independent program, nor is it automated.
 <br/>
The script is in Alpha prototype stage. 
Basic feature is usable, but is far from stable and mature.
 <br/>
For release plan please see <a href="https://github.com/Sheep-y/trpg-dnd-4e-db/issues/1">Task List</a>.

To try it out you can save the <a download="4e_database.html" href="http://raw.github.com/Sheep-y/trpg-dnd-4e-db/master/4e_database.html" target='download'>HTML</a> as a **local** file, then open it in **Internet Explorer**.
Due to technical reason the download page only works in Internet Explorer, but browsing would work in any modern browsers, including mobile phones.
