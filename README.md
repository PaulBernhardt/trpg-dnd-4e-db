# Offline 4e Database #

**For executable code please see <a href="http://github.com/Sheep-y/trpg-dnd-4e-db/tree/deployment">deployment branch</a>.**

This script can be used to reterives and locally stores entries from online 4e <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dndinsider/compendium/database.aspx">D&D Compendium</a>.
 <br/>
Stored entries can be browsed and searched using a Google-like index with multi-word term search, wildcast, exclusion, inclusion ("OR"), and even regular expression.

This is a fan-made project and does not contain any copyrighted data.
You will need an active <a href="http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Subscription.aspx">Dungeons & Dragons Insider subscription</a> to reterive or update data.
This is not an independent program, nor is it automated.
 <br/>
The script is in Alpha prototype stage. 
Basic feature is usable, but is far from stable and mature.

The source code is split into multiple files for easy management, and must be put together by the included Ant script before it can be run.
The <a href="http://github.com/Sheep-y/trpg-dnd-4e-db/tree/deployment">deployment branch</a> contains compiled releases. <br/>
Due to technical reason the download page only works in Internet Explorer, but browsing would work in any modern browsers, including mobile phones.
