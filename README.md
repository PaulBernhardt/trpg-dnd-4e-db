# Offline D&amp;D 4e Database #

This is the third iteration of a script that ask the browser to reterives entries from official <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dndinsider/compendium/database.aspx">D&D 4e Online Compendium</a> and store them in local files.
 <br/>
Stored entries can be browsed and searched offline using a Google-like index with exclusion, multi-word term search, and OR condition.

This is not an official project and does not contain any copyrighted data.
You will need an active <a href="http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Subscription.aspx">Dungeons & Dragons Insider subscription</a> to reterive or update data.
This is not an independent program, nor is it automated.
 <br/>
The script is still in Alpha prototype stage. 
Can download but usability is bad.
Support basic search, browse, and view but no style.

To try it out you can save the <a download="offline_database.html" href="http://raw.github.com/Sheep-y/trpg-dnd-4e-db/master/offline_database.html">solo HTML</a> from main branch as a local file, then open it in Internet Explorer.
Due to technical reason the download page only works in Internet Explorer, but browsing would work in any modern browsers, including mobile.

The source code, including Ant script used to build them, is in <a href="http://github.com/Sheep-y/trpg-dnd-4e-db/tree/development">development branch</a>.
